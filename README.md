Name of project: Pet Adoption Website

Overview:
In creating the pet adoptions page, a card template was first created for uniformity. Attributes included an image of the pet under its name, as well as information including the type of animal (cat, dog or dino), its color, and special skill.
Functions were then created in JS to iterate through the prefab objects array and list each one to be printed to the DOM. A filter was also created to sort the animals by type with the click of a button.
